# Car Shop 

I am proud to present a dynamic and responsive platform that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating IndexedDB as a database. The website is designed to provide an engaging and user-friendly experience, making it easy for users to browse and purchase vehicles online.

Using HTML, I structured the content of each page, while CSS was used to style the layout and design of the website. JavaScript made the website interactive and dynamic, allowing for smooth navigation and functionality. IndexedDB was integrated into the website as a database to store and retrieve vehicle detailsand user detais, making it easy for users to navigate through.

The website is designed to be responsive, meaning it adapts to various screen sizes and devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers, ensuring that the website remains accessible and user-friendly, regardless of the device.
